I pursue my Ph.D. in the [Data Analytics and Machine Learning (DAML)](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/startseite/) group at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I am supervised by [Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/).

My research focuses on **efficient** machine learning methods for **uncertainty estimation** for different **input** and **output types**. In particular, I am interested in defining **desiderata**, **models** and **evaluation** methods for practical uncertainty estimation in real world applications.

Other research interests include Structure Learning, Causal Inference and Efficient Machine Learning models.

If you are interested in discussing with me, contact me per email or on twitter :)
