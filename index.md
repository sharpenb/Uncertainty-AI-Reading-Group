title: Uncertainty in AI
subtitle: Reading Group
---

The UAI reading group is a great opportunity for researchers and students who are eager to learn and present your recent works about uncertainty estimation in AI. Concepts related to uncertainty estimation in AI are:

- Bayesian Neural Networks, 
- Ensembles
- Deterministic uncertainty quantification
- Conformal predictions
- Out-Of-Distribution detection
- Out-Of-Distribution generalization, 
- Calibration
- Correct/wrong prediction detections
- Benchmarks
- Continual learning
- Active learning
- Reinforcment learning
- Epistemic & aleatoric uncertainty.
