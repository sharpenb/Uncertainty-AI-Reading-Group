**Abstract**

We propose a novel probabilistic model over hierarchies on graphs obtained bycontinuous relaxation of tree-based hierarchies. We draw connections to Markovchain theory, enabling us to perform hierarchical clustering by efficient end-to-endoptimization of relaxed versions of quality metrics such as Dasgupta cost or Tree-Sampling Divergence (TSD). We show that our model learns rich, high-qualityhierarchies present in 11 real world graphs, including a large graph with 2.3Mnodes. Our model consistently outperforms recent as well as strong traditionalbaselines such as average linkage. Our model also obtains strong results on linkprediction despite not being trained on this task, highlighting the quality of thehierarchies discovered by our model.
